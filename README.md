Developed a comprehensive banking console application designed to simulate core banking operations in a secure and user-friendly manner. This application enables users to perform essential banking functions, including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and transaction history tracking, all through an intuitive command-line interface.

The application implements an efficient and structured approach to data handling and transaction management, ensuring accuracy and reliability in financial computations. It includes robust error handling and input validation mechanisms, providing a secure environment for users to interact with their accounts. Designed with modularity and scalability in mind, the application can be extended to integrate additional banking features as needed.

Key Features:

Account Management: Supports new account creation with user authentication and secure storage of account details.
Transaction Operations: Allows deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries with real-time updates and validation to prevent overdrafts and maintain data integrity.
Transaction History: Maintains and displays detailed transaction history for user accounts to aid in financial tracking.
Error Handling and Validation: Comprehensive error-handling routines ensure data consistency and prevent invalid operations, enhancing overall reliability.
Modular Design: Structured in a way that allows easy extension of new banking features and services.
Technologies Used: Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, Collections for Data Storage and Accessing.

This project demonstrates strong programming skills, attention to detail, and a solid understanding of core financial operations, making it a valuable addition to my technical portfolio.
